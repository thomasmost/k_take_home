# Take Home

> Minimal UI for viewing coins

**Note: I haven't tested the prod build, so just run the dev server.** Also, I didn't get a good linting/auto-fixer set up so the lint is bad, sorry :upside_down_face:

**Run dev server and view the app**
`npm run start-dev`

**Run tests**
`npx jest`

## Notes as I go

- CRA wasn't working, so I'm using this template
- CSS reset so I have a clean slate
- Using Inter, font from Kava website
- ~Tests aren't working but it looks like a config thing, not gonna spend time on it~ NVM
- Font sizes would normally be something I'd want to have a conversation about but for this exercise I'm just pixel-pushing

## Installation

1. Clone/download repo
2. `npm install`

## Usage

**Development**

`npm run start-dev`

- Build app continuously (HMR enabled)
- App served @ `http://localhost:8080`

**Test**

`npx jest`
